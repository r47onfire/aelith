# to do -1

* [ ] Change the lisp interpreter to compile to a VM bytecode state so that it can be suspended and saved in the savefile
* [ ] Make the menu screens and stuff have 2 default fonts, one for headings and callouts, and one for general text
* [ ] make the about screen not have hard-coded sections, and be data-driven
    * [ ] could this work for the config menus too?
* [ ] make looking automatically be smoothed by angle, versus instant
* [ ] make speech bubble using sprite for customization
* [X] make speech bubble advance logic be handled by entity rather than object to prevent a total lockup if the scene changes mid-sentence
* [ ] implement cutscene mode on player so camera follows but input is blocked
* [X] make tooltips in GUI be under the item permanently instead of popups that cover the item below it
* [ ] Add arm/hands to NIC
* [X] add "display entities" which are not tracked in the entity system but still run hooks for e.g. rendering and stuff
    * [ ] allow these as rendering decorations in the rooms
    * [X] make the title screen image out of this - sprite primitive + particles child, then a 3 channel animation on the sprite to match the existing waves
    * [ ] this is how the inventory menu screen should work as well
        * [ ] need to determine how the currently held item is rendered (does it rotate with the aim direction, does it match flip, etc)
* [ ] add random ticks functionality
* [ ] change motion to be using force & velocity (would make sticky platforms better)
* [X] finish legs
    * [ ] animate zug legs using this too
    * [ ] give the lil cuties antennae!
    * [ ] add "line from here to pos on other body" primitive
* [ ] need a way for objects to continue moving through unloaded rooms by utilizing nav mesh
    * "bully" cellular automata?
* [ ] need to put the "continue" code in a hook api function
* [ ] implement all of the settings stuff even if music manager is not fully implemented
    * [ ] hook lighting stuff into settings (how to turn off lighting??)
* [ ] fix bug with explorer headlight lighting explorer parts
* [X] remove "doors" section from room definition as I can just use entities for that
    * [ ] define check order when player presses action button
        1. try item currently holding
        2. try item looking at
        3. try item intersecting with (like door)
    * [ ] do this eagerly and show a hint overlay with the bound buttons
    * [ ] need for a way to be fallback and invoke the hook and stop if the hook exists else continue
        * [ ] something like Lisp's `(multiple-value-bind)` or similar on the startHook command
* [ ] implement nav mesh generation from world tiles
    * [ ] allow entities to navigate and move silently in the background when unloaded and then come to current room and be loaded
* [ ] NEED TO GET HOOK/RENDER/ANIM INHERITANCE WORKING
    * [ ] "super" command to run hook form "parent" prototype(s)
* [ ] make item pick-up be like minecraft (you get close & it automatically picks up; NIC and the player can exchange grabbable items by throwing them back and forth)
* [ ] have way to request NIC do stuff
    * [ ] lift player up out of sinkhole if they fall in and can't climb out
* [ ] add animations on discrete quantities (such as booleans and frame numbers)
* [ ] "hidden" settings entries so that options for how to interact with the items won't show up until the player has the item
* [ ] determine where to add haptic effects
* [ ] swimming
    * [ ] physics buoyancy effector
* [ ] tabbed settings menu
    * [ ] use unused spinner sfx for tab switch
    * [ ] L1/R1 buttons to switch tabs
* [ ] serialization of world state to JSON
* [ ] JUICE!! (Consult Amy on this.)
* [ ] possibly add more parkour stuff like ledge grab, wall jump, and double jump
    * why
    * make it configurable

## to draw

* separate downlight in aelith tileset into its own sprite and remove the baked glow effect (replace with an actual shader light)
    * [X] part 1 - remove it.
    * [ ] part 2 - add a new light entity type.

* player spaceship - crashed and fixed variants
* doors to enter / exit the Aelith
* mainframe computer
* 9-track tape
* NIC's arm
* MORE

## sounds to get or make

* [X] repeating drone noise for NIC movement
* same for spaceship movement
* [X] 3D printer done beep
* Elevator running
* MORE
