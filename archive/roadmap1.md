## TODO

* [ ] Make ZzFXM loading async so that it can not freeze the game when it loads all the songs
* [ ] Make the loading screen more fun
* [ ] Code renaming to support new story names
* [ ] Make control text for controls be defined as a transformation of the BUTTONS variable
* [ ] Move contextual actions for targeted items be below them like in the original demo
* [ ] Copy the LemmBox squish sounds for the vurble squish easter egg
* [ ] Memory boxes contain some bits of Scheme code and small comments, or are entirely text
  * [ ] Add Scheme syntax highlighter
  * [ ] User must 'open' the box to get the program if it contains one, and then 'run' it using a standalone computer terminal
    * [ ] Need to add 'computer terminals' player can interact with to get the vurbilizer rather than just picking it up.
  * [ ] Add "program" item that looks like a flash drive and can't be dropped, but can be used on computer terminals
  * [ ] Add "mainframe" big things that the player must turn on via a switch and then read their memory to be able to go to the next level
* [ ] Change the vurbilizers' definitions to be built using 'feature flags' `concurrent`, `global`, `radius 4`, `defer stay`, `edit`, `kill type`; `recapture`, `where invoked`, `tp catcher`, `fuzz`, `killer`, `immortal`, `die`, the player gets these flags to be able to put them in call/cc from the programs they use to get the other traps
* [ ] Make the setjmp and throw traps interfere with each other (capturing one kills the other's vurble spore) so the player can't use setjmp+throw together to cheese the bf1/bf2 swapping without using yield.
* [ ] Make the bugs aggro'ed at the vurble spore frogs and run towards them (and the player if they are holding one)
  * [ ] Make vurble spores auto-invoke when they are hit by a bug
    * [ ] Need to add a new flag to vurble spores to determine whether they teleport the entity that captured (all others), the entity that invoked or nobody (flag on call/cc).
* [ ] Make the bugs never get angry at the player if they don't have a vurble spore in their inventory
* [ ] Make the portals look like a 2nd kind of door instead of rainbow, and also teleport when the player knocks on it
  * [ ] Make the normal portal type that triggers the transition shader only when colliding, invisible (for like falling down to the bottom; the bottom can be a separate room)
* [ ] Add background manager (that uses parallax scrolling) for different room types
  * [ ] Have a way for the level to designate the tileset (which tiles to use for walls, ladders, gratings, and vines/wires) and have the tiles or MParser look at this
    * [ ] perhaps use folders?
* [ ] Port all 9 of that_dos_server's songs to zzfxm
    `Co-authored-by: that_dos_server <ihatebluescreens@proton.me>`
* [ ] Make the lore popups in-game be from a floating computer AI thingy "NIC" rather than just floating text
  * [ ] The player can interact with them to show the latest text
    * [ ] Add dddddddd sound when the words come out
    * [ ] Add Inform-like random text choosing for snarky comments
  * [ ] follow the player around like a minecraft dog or something
  * [ ] Dialog system includes direction tags
    * [ ] `<anim:foo>` to cause NIC to play an animation
    * [ ] `<lookat:tag>` to make NIC go to and look at a particular thing (like note blocks to allays in Minecraft)
    * [ ] `<do:action>` to perform an action on the item (like action1, target1, etc)
      * [ ] Rework the actions system to make the actions take an actor parameter to differentiate between NIC and the player performing the action (so like for grabbing, it can give the item to NIC instead of the player)
      * [ ] Add `actor()` component to facilitate this, which manages inventory, motion, and model (bones and stuff, loaded from JSON)
    * [ ] `<drop_item>` to cause NIC to drop the item so the player can grab it
    * [ ] `<splash:n:colors>` to drop a splash of particles,
    * [ ] `<think:time>` to display a '...' thinking animation
    * (& anything else expressive)?
* [ ] remove the rainbow special control thing on items, only have NIC use them
  * [ ] make the links for all of the same class of things that would show the same manpage, use the same specials bits
  * [ ] add more random text stuff
* [ ] Fix typewriter code to use [Intl.Segmenter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter) to split the text (so it works with Japanese which doesn't use any spaces)
* [ ] make the player sprite have hands that come around and hold the thing that they are grabbing
* [ ] Once MF adds CCD kinematic constraints, make the arms and legs using bones instead of spritesheet animation (smaller spritesheet etc & more expressive animations defined in code vs anim).
  * [ ] would prefer to wait on cached physics too
  * [ ] Hands can be in their own layer, on top of grabbing but below wires
* [ ] Make the spaceship sprite be like a vehicle the player can get in
  * [ ] separate the player
* [ ] integrate suave's lit shaders
  * glowing lights go on lights (duh), vurbilizers, vurble spores, vurble spore world markers, etc.
* [ ] Make pause menu NOT a terminal since aesthetic is changing away from that
* [ ] Make pause menu work with mouse, need text quad character detection for this
* [ ] Make flash trail that shows activation of things follow the data wires
* [ ] Fix bug where horn / tail doesn't teleport to the player and gets extremely stretched.
* [ ] Make NEW vacuum object, like a grabber
* [ ] Add more challenges that test all features of call/cc.
  * [ ] Use firewall somewhere else
* [ ] Add algorithmic choosing songs based on where you are in the game. Currently just random & uniformly weighted -- make it choose randomly but influenced based on position
  * [ ] Fix the not auto looping onEnd getting dropped for music (probably Kaplay bug)
  * [ ] Could also have the songs for each biome be the different genres. Core Aelith be my conventional meter songs, surface be tds's slower songs, and the caves be the weird odd time signature songs
* [ ] Add static level baking using the build script (MParser runs at build time and produces JSON imported using a onLoad plugin, savefiles are then deltas to transform this master state into the saved state)
  * [ ] For large collider instances, make them `{ kind: whatever, instances: [x,y,w,h][] }` in tiles from 0,0
  * [ ] Use build script to roll all of the data into one giant JSON file using dataURLs for the images in the JSON
* [ ] Make the Windows crash screen at the end use the newer QR code format and link to a secret page with the epilogue? (Using <https://www.npmjs.com/package/qr.js> to not have to create a texture for the image)
* [ ] Add autosave (last checkpoint) and option to restore when webpage is reloaded
  * [ ] How to refer to objects in-memory in serialized form?
    * [ ] Ones that don't exist, when savegame is loaded initially at start?
  * [ ] OR - Add warning about there being no autosave
* [ ] Add achievements for stuff? (Collecting vurble spores, creating vurble spores, cloning boxes, etc?)
  * [ ] Connect to Newgrounds for cloud save and medals?
* [ ] IN-GAME MAP EDITOR!!! would make my life so much easier

## Other ideas

* Make an animation toolkit where the players' movement is disconnected from the input, and can be animated for like cutscenes and stuff
* add lasers, mirrors, and laser detectors
  * need a computer analogy name for it
* add a sandbox mode at the end called the "assembler"
  * need a way for player to edit the world and change links
  * using a special continuation gun thing?
